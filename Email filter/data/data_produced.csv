The calculations are still a bit rough but I thought this spreadsheet would provide you with something to review.  I have used a $35 Pool Price in the calculations.  Note the additional tabs in the spreadsheet that detail the hourly generation that the Pool has received for SD3 and SD4 . In determining the actual security required, we will need to review the megawatts in the contracts registered in detail once we have the acknowledgements tomorrow.  For simplicity I have assumed that everything is base load and I know this is not correct.  Once we know exactly what contracts we are looking at, we can fine tune the calculation."
